\title{Fix Residue within Peptide Fragment}
\usage{
fixResidue(fragment, peptide, site)
}
\arguments{
\item{fragment}{A character string representing the peptide fragment.}

\item{peptide}{A character string representing the full peptide sequence.}

\item{site}{An integer representing the site position of the residue within the fragment.}
}
\value{
A data frame containing the fixed residue information, including fragment, peptide, site, residue, position, window, and match status.
}
\description{
This function attempts to fix a residue within a peptide fragment by performing a local alignment
between the fragment and the full peptide sequence. It calculates the new position, residue, and window
and returns the fixed residue information.
}
\details{
Perform Local Alignment: The function uses the pairwiseAlignment function from the Biostrings package to perform a local alignment between the peptide and the fragment.
Calculate New Position: The new position of the residue is calculated based on the alignment's start position and the provided site.
Extract New Residue: The new residue is extracted from the peptide sequence at the calculated position.
Extract New Window: The getWindow function is called to extract a window around the new position from the peptide sequence.
Determine Match: The function determines whether the fragment and the new window match based on various conditions.
Return Result: The function returns a data frame containing the fixed residue information, including the fragment, peptide, site, residue, position, window, and match status.
